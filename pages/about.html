			<h3> My Story </h3>
			<p> I'm a UX/UI designer with a passion for creating digital experiences that feel intuitive, human, and meaningful. I’m graduating from Appalachian State University with a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies, where I focused on the intersection of design, psychology, and programming.</p>
			<p> Through courses in graphic design, research methods, technical writing, and front-end development, I've built a strong foundation in both the creative and technical sides of user experience. I’ve also earned the Google UX Design Professional Certificate to further deepen my skills. </p>
			<p> Beyond the classroom, I worked as an AR/VR artist at Duke Energy, where I collaborated with developers and created 3D assets—an experience that sharpened both my design thinking and team communication. </p>
			<p> I'm excited about designing technology that connects with people and improves everyday interactions. </p>
			<h3> Design Principles <h3>
